# jwaim - csgo multi-cheat for linux
This is a cheat for the 64 bit linux csgo (tested on ubuntu 17.04)  
It utilizes QT graphics library to draw ESP and other info on screen  

I uploaded it here to share with anyone interested, and mainly just so that I don't lose track of it. I hope anyone who finds this can find it useful for learning or for fun.   

Thanks to every helpful person at unknowncheats!

# installing and running
install additional dependencies:
```bash
apt-get install libboost-all-dev libx11-dev libx11-dev:i386 libxtst-dev libconfig++-dev build-essential qt5-default
```

how to build:

install the dependencies (above).

navigate to the base directory (usually ~/jwaim).

run command:
```bash
qmake ./jwaim.pro
```
run command: 
```bash
make
```
rename settings-example.cfg to settings.cfg and modify settings to your liking.

NOTE:
please make sure you have settings.cfg in the same directory as your current working directory (when you execute the application), otherwise you will experience problems with libconfig.
